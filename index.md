The Digital Mentoring project offers free and open source resources for mathematical learning in learning management systems (LMS). The offered resources add interactive elements and learning analytics to the default LMS mechanisms. The project aims on lightweight implementations, that lecturers can easily adapt to their online courses. You can check the [demo implementation](https://moodleresearch.hs-bochum.de/?lang=en) or browse this site for specific information.

# Exercises
We compiled <span class="dm-exercise-amount">61</span> [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) exercises for study beginners to train their mathematical skills. These exercises give error adaptive feedback for known error patterns. They have already successful been tested in mathematics preparatory courses of several universities. You can download the free and open source exercises (e.g., as [XML (german, normal design)](./question-files/questions-normal_ger.xml)) and include them in your LMS (Moodle / ILIAS). Check the [Exercises section](./exercises/) for further versions and information.

# Interactive Features
Besides the integrated feedback of [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) exercsies, lecturers want to implement additional

# Learning Analytics

# Demo
Check out the [online demo](https://moodleresearch.hs-bochum.de/?lang=en). The exercises, designs and learning analytics approaches are implemented within the learning management system [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) without any additional plugins.
