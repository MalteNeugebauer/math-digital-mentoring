The Digital Mentoring project offers free and open source resources for mathematical learning in the learning management systems (LMS) [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) and [ILIAS](https://www.ilias.de/en/). The offered resources add interactive elements and learning analytics to the default LMS mechanisms based on [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/). The project aims on lightweight implementations, that lecturers can easily adapt to their online courses with on-board tools of the LMS. Get an overview with the [demo implementation](https://moodleresearch.hs-bochum.de/?lang=en) or browse this site for specific information.

# Exercises
<div class="columns is-tablet">
<div class="column is-three-quarters-desktop is-half-tablet">
<span markdown="1">We compiled </span><span class="dm-exercise-amount">61</span><span markdown="1"> exercises for study beginners with the help of the [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) plugin. These exercises give error adaptive feedback for known error patterns, so that learners can gradually improve their mathematical skills. These exercises have already successful been tested in mathematics preparatory courses of several universities. You can download the free and open source exercises (e.g., as [XML](./question-files/questions-normal_en.xml)) and include them in your LMS (Moodle / ILIAS). Check the [repository](https://github.com/MalteNeugebauer/math-digital-mentoring) for further versions and information.</span>

# Interactive Features
<div class="columns is-tablet">
<div class="column is-three-quarters-desktop is-half-tablet">
<span markdown="1">Besides the integrated feedback of [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) exercsies, lecturers may want to implement additional interactive elements in their exercises. Famous examples are ad-hoc feedback, guidance, scaffolding or gamification elements. These can be realized with the help of Javascript, which has the advantage, that no additional plugin has to be installed. Check for example the [endboss variant of the compiled exercise set (XML)](./question-files/questions-pa-its_ger.xml), which simply adds skull symbols to the hardest exercises. Or you may want to check the [fantasy game variant (XML)](./question-files/questions-rpg_ger.xml). The features can be used independently, thus, they can also be implemented in your exercises. Check the [repository's LMS-readable Packages Section](https://github.com/MalteNeugebauer/math-digital-mentoring#lms-readable-packages) for further variants and explanations.</span>

# Learning Analytics
<div class="columns is-tablet">
<div class="column is-three-quarters-desktop is-half-tablet">
<span markdown="1">Basing on the [research related to the project](./research/), we developed a dashboard for STACK exercsies, that can be implemented in Moodle without the need of installing a plugin. The dashboard visualizes how learners use a quiz: their movements between exercises, amounts of attempts, helpfulness of feedback, amount of repetitions. To use it, simply copy the dashboard code and paste it into your browser's console on your LMS course\'s site. For a step-by-step instruction and further opportunities to run the dashboard, please refer to the [repository's Effect Measurement Section](https://github.com/MalteNeugebauer/math-digital-mentoring#effect-measurement).</span>

# Demo
You can directly try out the exercises and features in the [online demo](https://moodleresearch.hs-bochum.de/?lang=en). In this demo, the exercises, designs and learning analytics approaches are implemented within the learning management system [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) without any additional plugins.
